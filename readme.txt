let us make something funny. Let is call it "Future Girl Friend Prediction" :D Alex (or maybe you ) is a programmer and single. He has not time to go outside :D (reminds you somebody? ) so since he is a programmer, he kept a book of girls he dated and made some list of girls he dated. 
Alex works , has no time . So he makes a program to predict, if future girls will like you or not . And Voile :D 
so after this imaginary scenerio, let us look what program does. It is a decision tree and confusion matrix program. If you have difficulties to understand label automation please ask. I used manual label entry in first program and used Seaborn to show graphic. but i wanted to use sklearn since i liked it and easy to remember. 
when you run program first, you will see Confusion matrix , after you close it you will see decision tree. 
sure the data inside CSV file has not enough dataset. but it is just a demo. 
if you want to see how to label manually, i can also upload the first version of this program. Anyway program has error handler when you enter wrong label it will warn you. 

Further ideas: put this easly inside a tkinter form ( i will do it soon) so it will be better. Feed the table with more data. 
try it with seaborn (need to measure time which one is faster ).
